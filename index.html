    <h2 id="h2num2">History</h2>
    <p>Jimi Hendrix was born in Washington, Seattle. As a teen, Hendrix was caught driving stolen cars twice and was given a choice between going to prison and joining the army. Enlisting into the army, Hendrix finished his 8 weeks of basic training at Fort Ord in California. He was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and was stationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.<br><br> It was clear that Hendrix didn't have any intrest in the army because of his neglect of his duties. On June 29th, 1962, Hendrix was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions. Hendrix made lots of connections and relationships along his music career but none of them were more important than Noel Redding (The bands bassiest) and Mitch Mitchell (The bands drummer).</p>
